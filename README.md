# Code for Good 2024 - IFTR Project

This project was developed during the Code for Good 2024 hackathon hosted by J.P. Morgan Chase. The aim was to address a real-world challenge for the NGO Indigenous and Frontier Technology Research Centre (IFTR), which is dedicated to helping farmers with data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization to create insightful reports and personalized suggestions. Our solution facilitates communication between the NGO and farmers, eliminating the need for volunteer intervention.
